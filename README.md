# Handwritten Alphabet Classifier  
A machine learning project to classify grayscale images of handwritten alphabets (A-Z) using various models, from SVMs and logistic regression to neural networks.  


## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains grayscale images (28x28 pixels) for 26 alphabets (A-Z).

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Explore class distribution.  
   - Normalize and preprocess the images.  
   - Visualize reconstructed images.  

2. **Model Implementation**  
   - **SVM Classifiers**: Train models with linear and nonlinear kernels.  
   - **Logistic Regression**: Build a one-vs-all classifier from scratch.  
   - **Neural Networks**: Design, train, and evaluate models with TensorFlow.  

3. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Use metrics like confusion matrix and F1-scores.  
   - Compare models and determine the most effective approach.
